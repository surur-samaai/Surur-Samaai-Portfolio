I had the privilege of teaching Mr Samaai in 2021 and while he was only a second year in 2022, he was nominated and appointed as a tutor. Over the last two years, Mr Samaai has proved his reliability, resilience, and competence, often going beyond his required responsibilities in his position as tutor. As a student his assessments indicated his ability to work independently, and our correspondence showed that he was willing to admit when he needed help. I believe given the space and opportunity, Mr Samaai will be able to flourish in any position. I sincerely hope this short note has successfully relayed my thoughts so that you would positively consider Mr Samaaiâ€™s application.",
